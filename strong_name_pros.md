#Scenarios where strong-naming is good
----------------------------
Add any scenarios where having/using strong-named open source assemblies is good
for you as a user, developer, or contributor.

Remember: We're only considering the case where strong-named assemblies have the full strong-name key
in the code repository.

If possible, keep scenarios on separate lines and put your username, name or email at the end of your scenario.
If you want to respond to a scenario, place your response right after the scenario and indent by one.

Example:

* Here is a scenario - username
  * A response to your suggestion - responder_username

--------------------------------
* Strong-named open source libraries can be used by other strong-named libraries and applications. - ericschultz
